- if you seek for something to be done grep for TODO ... youll surely find something suitable for you

- refactor/rewrite the webcam handling class to not use threads 
	and implement other "drivers" such as v4l2, windoze, bsd
	- get rid of the client/server design of the webcam-class (way too complicated)
	
- implement a wizard (have a look at src/dialogs/wizard)

- does the rtp-stack needs to use threads? im not sure why it should
- the sip-stack should not know anything about the gui!

- make audio-codecs tunable/configurable

!!- refactor/rewrite sip stack. code is way too complicated! im sure you dont need your own timer class (there are two classes!)

- do buffering of RTP-Packets in the rtp-baseclass.
- do de-jittering also in rtp-baseclass
- adaptive jitterbuffer?

- review/rewrite the code so that audio-codecs with other framelength than 20ms can also be used. (speex narrowband with 10ms or 30ms, ilbc 30ms...)

- write alsa-driver (see arc/audio/audiobase and arts)

-port to qt4
- make simple qt-only (windoes) GUI
